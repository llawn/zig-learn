# Zig-Learn

A comprehensive journey through the implementation of fundamental computer science concepts using the Zig Programming Language.
This repository serves as a personal laboratory for learning and exploring data structures, algorithms, and design patterns.

## Quick Start

!!! note "Prerequisites"
\- Zig 0.15+
\- Git
\- A terminal or code editor

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llawn/zig-learn.git
cd zig-learn
# Run any example
zig run data_structures/01_linear/01_arrays.zig
```

## What's Included

- **Data Structures**: From arrays to advanced graph structures
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and optimization algorithms
- **Design Patterns**: Creational, structural, and behavioral patterns
- **Practice Projects**: Real-world implementations

## Documentation

- [Data Structures](data_structures/linear.md) - Complete data structure implementations
- [Algorithms](algorithms.md) - Algorithm implementations and analysis
- [Design Patterns](patterns.md) - Software design patterns in Zig
- [Practice Projects](projects.md) - Hands-on coding challenges
- [Resources](resources.md) - Learning materials and references

## Progress

This is an ongoing learning project. Check the [README](../README.md) for the latest progress and implementation status.
